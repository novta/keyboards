<p>This keyboard layout was developed on behalf of the Osage Nation Language Department 
with the intention of replacing previous layouts (partially for reasons pertaining 
to orthography reforms that have been carried since the last Osage keyboard was developed)
</p>
<h2>Font</h2>
<p>
The keyboard comes with the Pawhuska font. This and other Osage fonts are available from <a href="http://osagelanguagetools.appspot.com/downloads/" target=_blank>here</a>.
